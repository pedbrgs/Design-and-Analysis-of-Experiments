### About
<p align="justify">
This repository contains the source codes for the case studies and final project of "Design and Analysis of Experiments" course (EEE933). All experiments and statistical analyzes were implemented in R and reports were produced using <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a>. Each case study contains a technical report in Portuguese, which aims to describe data collection, exploratory analysis, test hypotheses, statistical analysis and conclusions. The experiments carried out in the case studies were:

* **[Case Study 1:](https://github.com/pedbrgs/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments/blob/master/Case%20Study%201/report.pdf)** Performance comparison of two software versions.
* **[Case Study 2:](https://github.com/pedbrgs/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments/blob/master/Case%20Study%202/report.pdf)** Comparison of Body Mass Index (BMI) of PPGEE students between 2016 and 2017 (2nd semester).
* **[Case Study 3:](https://github.com/pedbrgs/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments/blob/master/Case%20Study%203/report.pdf)** Comparison of five stocks through the financial time series.
* **[Case Study 4:](https://github.com/pedbrgs/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments/blob/master/Case%20Study%204/report.pdf)** Performance comparison of two algorithm configurations for a set of instances.
* **Final Project:** Hyperparameter tuning of Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm in the Benchmark Functions of the [CEC’2013](http://www.tflsgo.org/assets/cec2018/cec2013-lsgo-benchmark-tech-report.pdf).
